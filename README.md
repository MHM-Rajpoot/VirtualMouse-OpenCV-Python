Computer Vision Mouse


__Introduction:__

Overview: 
In this documentation, we will explore the concept of controlling the mouse cursor on a computer using hand gestures and computer vision techniques. This innovative approach eliminates the need for traditional input devices like a mouse or touchpad and enables users to interact with the computer using hand movements.

Document Scope: 
The scope of this documentation is to provide comprehensive instructions and guidance for utilizing a system that allows controlling the mouse cursor on a computer using hand gestures and computer vision techniques. It covers the necessary steps from installation and setup to gesture recognition and mouse control actions. The document aims to cater to users who are interested in exploring alternative input methods and leveraging computer vision technology for intuitive and hands-free computer interaction.


__Architecture and Design:__

System Architecture: 
The system architecture for controlling the mouse through computer vision using hand gestures involves multiple components working together to enable real-time hand tracking, gesture recognition, and mouse control.

Data Flow: 
An Image is captured then it is passed to classifier to check for any hands in it then if a hand is found all 20 points are labeled on the image and an array of these points is returned for further processing to guess the pose of the hand.


__Installation and Setup:__

This software has no installer; you just download the folder and run VirtualMouse.exe. FInally, Press ESC to exit the program.
